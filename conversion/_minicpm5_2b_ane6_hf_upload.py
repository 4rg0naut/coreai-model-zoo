"""Replace the MiniCPM5-2B Neural Engine bundles on HF with the 6-bit export (S5, 2026-09-16). USER-GATED — run only when asked.

mlboydaisuke/MiniCPM5-2B-CoreAI:
  ios-ane-h18p/   metadata.json + minicpm5_2b_minicpm5_pal6_g8_static.h18p.aimodelc + tokenizer/   (AOT h18p, ANE, 2.5 GB)
  ios-static/     metadata.json + minicpm5_2b_minicpm5_pal6_g8_static.aimodel      + tokenizer/   (the IR before AOT, 1.9 GB)
The previous files in those two subtrees (the 2026-09-15 4-bit g32 export) are deleted in the same commits, and the card's
"Neural Engine bundle" section is rewritten. Staging = coreai-models/exports/hf_stage/MiniCPM5-2B-CoreAI/ (built from
export_minicpm5.py --ios-ane --qconfig minicpm5_pal6_g8.yaml == ondevice/_ane_gate/_ane_export_s1.py, gated on the phone).

`ios-ane-h18p/` is Apple's stock `coreai.llm.export --platform iOS` static export of this checkpoint at
**6-bit k-means palettization, group 8** (the shape of Apple's own iOS preset for Qwen3-1.7B;
`conversion/minicpm5_pal6_g8.yaml` in the zoo; embeddings int8; static graphs `prompt_opt`/`extend` ×
contexts {256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096} × query {8, 16, 64}), AOT-compiled with
`xcrun coreai-build compile --platform iOS --preferred-compute neural-engine --architecture h18p`
(31/31 ANE regions, 2.5 GB). It loads through Apple's `EngineFactory` → `StaticShapeEngine` unchanged
(iPhone 17-class devices). `ios-static/` is the same export before AOT — the portable IR; compile it
for another chip yourself.

Why 6-bit: the 2026-09-15 bundle was Apple's iOS default (4-bit, group 32). It passed the three short
gate prompts but diverged from fp32 at the first token of a 109-token free-form answer (and got the
physics wrong). At 6-bit the same phone matches fp32 token-for-token on the three short prompts (24/24,
8/8 including the stop, 16/16) and for 33 tokens of the long answer, then diverges on a step where fp32
itself is nearly tied (top-2 margin 0.17); 5 of its 109 teacher-forced steps differ — transcript
`models/minicpm5-2b/gate-minicpm5-2b-ane-6bit-device.json` in the zoo. An 8-bit shape is exact in an
fp32 simulation of the recipe, but the 2B at 8 bits (2.16 GB of weights) loads on the ANE and never
returns its first token, and 4-bit group 8 does not compile for the ANE at all — zoo
`knowledge/ane-vs-gpu-iphone-2026-09.md` §9.

Speed on an iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 27.0), same day, engine released and idle until the thermal state was
back at `fair`, then 60 s of 128-token-prompt / 256-token trials: **38.5 tok/s decode** (flat over the
minute), prefill 1679 tok/s, footprint 2.6 GB. In the same run the `int8/` GPU bundle decoded 23.8 tok/s;
the previous 4-bit ANE bundle did ~55 (`models/minicpm5-2b/bench-iphone-ane-6bit-vs-gpu-2026-09-16.json`).
**The first launch on a phone builds the ANE programs: about 23 minutes** (0.2 s afterwards; the cache
lives in the app's container and is invalidated by an iOS update).

Task accuracy, GSM8K test (first 200 questions, 0-shot CoT, greedy, no-think, max 640 new tokens; same
prompt and scoring as the litertlm-convert evals) — `models/minicpm5-2b/gsm8k-200-2026-09-17.json` in the zoo:

| model | correct / 200 |
|---|---:|
| fp32 checkpoint (bf16 on a Mac) | 172 (86.0 %) |
| **`ios-ane-h18p/` 6-bit, on the iPhone 17 Pro** | **173 (86.5 %)** |
| the same 6-bit recipe applied to the fp32 weights (Mac) | 172 (86.0 %) |
| the `int8/` recipe applied to the fp32 weights (Mac) | 171 (85.5 %) |
| the replaced 4-bit bundle, on the iPhone 17 Pro | 131 (65.5 %) |
